 *
 * Template file to set up a Heirarchical State Machine to work with the Events and
 * Services Framework (ES_Framework) on the Uno32 for the CMPE-118/L class. Note that
 * this file will need to be modified to fit your exact needs, and most of the names
 * will have to be changed to match your code.
 *
 * There is another template file for the SubHSM's that is slightly differet, and
 * should be used for all of the subordinate state machines (flat or heirarchical)
 *
 * This is provided as an example and a good place to start.
 *
 * History
 * When           Who     What/Why
 * -------------- ---     --------
 * 09/13/13 15:17 ghe      added tattletail functionality and recursive calls
 * 01/15/12 11:12 jec      revisions for Gen2 framework
 * 11/07/11 11:26 jec      made the queue static
 * 10/30/11 17:59 jec      fixed references to CurrentEvent in RunTemplateSM()
 * 10/23/11 18:20 jec      began conversion from SMTemplate.c (02/20/07 rev)
